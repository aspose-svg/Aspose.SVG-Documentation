**Welcome to Aspose.SVG for .NET**

Aspose.SVG for .NET enables your applications to perform a great range of document processing tasks on SVG files. You can load, save and convert SVG files using the API. The API also lets you read and traverse the elements of an SVG file through its Document Object Model (DOM) API that is fully compatible with SVG specifications. The API is not dependent on any other components and can be used without installing other applications.

## **Product Description**
Aspose.SVG for .NET is implemented using Managed C# and can be used with any .NET language like C#, VB.NET, J# and so on. It can be used to develop a variety of .NET applications ranging from Windows Desktop to ASP.NET web applications. The API comes with a rich set of featured examples written in C# that developers can use to get started with the API in no time.
## **Declaration**
All Aspose .NET components require Full Trust permission set. The reason is, Aspose .NET components need to access registry settings, system files other than virtual directory for certain operations like parsing fonts, etc. Moreover, Aspose .NET Components are based on core .NET system classes that also require Full Trust permission set in many cases.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such security level applies the following constraints:

- OleDbPermission is not available. This means you cannot use the ADO.NET managed OLE DB data provider to access databases.
- EventLogPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the Windows event log.
- ReflectionPermission is not available. This means you cannot use reflection.
- RegistryPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the registry.
- WebPermission is restricted. This means your application can only communicate with an address or range of addresses that you define in the <trust> element.
- FileIOPermission is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application's virtual directory hierarchy.

Due to the reasons specified above, Aspose .NET components cannot be used on servers granting permission set other than Full Trust.
