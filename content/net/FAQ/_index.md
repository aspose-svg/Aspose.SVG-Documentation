## **What is SVG?**

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based image format for two-dimensional graphics; its specifications are produced and maintained by the W3C consortium. It is a vector graphics format intended primarily for the Web; it has been designed to work on web sites in agreement with HTML, Javascript, and CSS.  SVG is supported in all modern browsers, except IE 9 and lower. The main excellence of SVG is an unmatched ability to be scaled to any size without any shred of quality degradation.

### **Why is vector graphics important?**

Vector graphics using is one of the most popular Web design trends during the last years. SVG allows developers and designers to create vector-based images that are constructed using points, lines, paths and shapes. It is best used for logos, icons and simple graphics making. Benefits of SVG are scalability, file size, editing capabilities, performance, style control, advanced options and other vector graphics advantages.

### **How to open the SVG format?**

A great thing about the SVG file format is that you can open it even if you don’t have a specific image editor like Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw. You can view it in any modern browser. Moreover, SVG images can be created, viewed, constructed and edited with your convenient text editor.

### **What is SVG used for?**

The SVG file format is multifunctional. Benefits of SVG such as scalability, file size, performance and interactivity make it flexible particular for web applying:

 - SVG images are scalable and perfect for a responsive design; they look fine on screens of any resolution.
 - SVG help you place on your websites some interactive piece like a map, a diagram, infographic or a lightweight game. It will keep the users attention on the things what you need.
 - SVG helps cardinally cut your site or app file weight.

### **Can I use SVG as a background image?**

   Yes. SVG images can be used as a background image in CSS as well, just like PNG, JPG, or GIF. The unique characteristic that makes SVG ideal for page backgrounds is scalability. Moreover, SVG patterns propose a flexible approach to repeating a background image on a web page. They have a relatively simple syntax allows easy and clear their usage.


## **SVG icons. Why should you use them?**

Since SVG icons are only a block of code in XML format, their sizes are much smaller to that of image PNG JPEG icons. 
In the web, SVG icons have got an essential part of UI design. Their using ensures better performance, higher accessibility standards, high rendering quality, unrivalled flexibility, and extensive customization. SVG icons are used in applications, websites, marketing materials, etc. They create visual interest, punctuate topics, and draw user focus.

### **How to create SVG icons?**

To draw SVG icons, you can use vector graphics editors, such as Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Adobe Flash Professional or CorelDRAW.
You can create an icon or logo by hand from scratch; you can rework an existing icon in any text editor. For this, you should learn some SVG basics, and be able to read and understand the structure of simple SVG files. We hope the **[Drawing Basics](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/drawing-basics/)** section will help you to learn more about SVG.

### **What is an SVG logo?**

SVG is not well suited for drawing photorealistic images. SVG files work best for images that contain less detail than a photograph such as icons, logos, maps, illustrations, etc. 

SVG logos are simple images with clearly defined borders. Logos appear in website headers, emails, and printed on anything from pamphlets to billboards. They tend to be simpler in design, which gives nicely to the SVG format.

## **What is the power of SVG sprites?**

An SVG sprite is a single large file with graphics, resulting from the merging of several small graphic files (SVG icons, design elements). Such a way of files design is needful to save the number of requests to the server: the fewer requests, the faster the site works and downloads.

### **Why use SVG sprites?**

 Using SVG sprites on your website, you get smaller graphics weight and fewer server requests. The faster the site, the more the search engines and visitors like it.

### **Inline and linked SVG sprites, what is the difference?**

The difference is where the sprite resides, in the body of HTML document or an external file.
Being an XML code, SVG can be embedded in an HTML document as a code fragment using the `<svg>` element, which will serve as a container for icons and is going to be an inline type of SVG sprite which you are going to use. The HTML document with an embedded SVG sprite will load faster because there is no need for other network requests to load each of the SVG files.
Linked sprites can be used directly from HTML document or CSS files. This type of sprites is beneficial for creating excellent SVG icons system. 

### **How to create an SVG sprite?**

There are some ways to create SVG sprites:
1. Using vector software – such as Adobe Illustrator CC or Sketch. However, the code they produce needs some editing to use as an icon system. 

2. Creating SVG sprites by hand. This way could get time-consuming and tedious.

3. Using online sprite creators. Aspose.SVG Online [**SVG Sprite Generator**](https://products.aspose.app/svg/svg-sprite-generator) offers a convenient way to automate the process of SVG sprites making.


## **What is text vectorization?**

Text Vectorization is the process of converting text into digital graphics. In the vectorized SVG text, all font glyphs are replaced with the combination of `<path>`, `<use>`, `<mask>`, `<g>` elements, and etc. Such a text cannot be edited. Thus, the text vectorization serves as some text security from unwanted using, borrowing, and editing.

### **How to vectorize text?**

Aspose.SVG for .NET API provides the feature of text vectorization in SVG documents. More details see in **[Text Vectorization & Text Security](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/how-to-work-with-aspose-svg-api/text-vectorization/)** section. [**Text to Vector**](https://products.aspose.app/svg/text-to-vector) web application is intended to replace text elements in SVG files with vector graphics. In the vectorized SVG text, all font glyphs are replaced with a combination of graphic elements. Such a text become a vector drawing and cannot be edited.

## **Why convert SVG to PNG?**

All modern browsers support SVG, and it would seem that the Web should already switch to vector graphics. However,  there are some restrictions on the use of SVG.

### **How to convert SVG to PNG?**

It is effortless and simple. You can try to convert SVG to PNG or a variety of other formats with our **[Free Online SVG Converter](https://products.aspose.app/svg/conversion)**. Converting SVG documents to other formats is one of the main features of Aspose.SVG for .NET API.
