description:  The articles in this chapter provide the required information to start working with Aspose.SVG class library. We look at how the DOM represents an SVG document in memory and how to use API for SVG files creating, editing, saving, converting, and merging. The articles provide various C# examples (code snippets) of creating, loading, saving, editing, converting and merging SVG files using Aspose.SVG for .NET API.

SVG files use an XML-based text format to describe how the image should appear. SVG is a resolution-independent format, and SVG files can be scaled to different sizes without losing quality. The SVG format has all the advantages of vector graphics and many other advantages over bitmap formats. SVG is available in all modern web browsers,  and as we look forward, it is easy to see that SVG files are the future of web design graphics.

The articles in this chapter provide the required information to start working with Aspose.SVG class library. We look at how to use API for SVG files creating, editing and saving. Along with the powerful DOM API, one of the key features of Aspose.SVG is quality rendering and converting to many popular formats, such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and GIF. Moreover, this library offers additional saving and rendering options, SVG documents merging, SVG text vectorization, applying scripts, SVG filter effects, and more.
