## **Major Features**

As per the regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honored to announce the April release of Aspose.SVG for .NET:

* several improvements were added to the code working with TTF substitution tables;
* new approximation algorithms for the processing of Gaussian Blur and Morphological filters were implemented, which made it possible to avoid the problem of exponential growth of the execution time depending on the size of the kernel.
