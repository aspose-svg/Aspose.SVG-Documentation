## **Major Features**

As per the regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honored to announce the February release of Aspose.SVG for .NET:

* this release contains significant improvements in text processing algorithms, namely in matching code units to glyphs, it is now possible to work with complex matching scenarios are common in non-Latin scripts. This means that non-Latin scripting languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi, etc. will be processed more correctly and accurately.

## **Public API changes:**

### **Added APIs:**

    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the width of the glyph, in points.
        /// </summary>
        /// <value>
        /// Width in points.
        /// </value>
        public float Width { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the offset to the next glyph in points.
        /// </summary>
        /// <value>
        /// Offset in points.
        /// </value>
        public float Offset { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the index of this glyph in the font.
        /// </summary>
        /// <value>
        /// Index of the glyph.
        /// </value>
        public uint Index { get; }

}
```

    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets information about rendered glyphs.
        /// </summary>
        /// <value>
        /// A <see cref="IList{GlyphInfo}" /> that contains information about rendered glyphs.

        public IList<GlyphInfo> GlyphInfos { get; }
    }
}
```
