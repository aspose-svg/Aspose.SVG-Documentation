{{% /alert %}}

## **Major Features**

As per the regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are proud to announce the March release of Aspose.SVG for .NET, which includes the following update:

* Fixed an issue where certain characters were displayed twice during SVG to PDF conversion (issue SVGNET-182). The root cause of this issue was incorrect processing of ligatures, which are special character combinations used in certain fonts to create more legible and visually appealing text. In this release, we have addressed this problem and also improved the rendering of ligatures in general.

## **Compatibility Notice**

We would like to remind our customers that starting from version 23.4, we will only be supporting .NetStandard 2.0.
