{{% /alert %}}

## **Major Features**

As per the regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are proud to announce the April release of Aspose.SVG for .NET, which includes the following update:

* The major additions in this release is support for using 7 lookup tables in TrueType fonts. These lookup tables, enable correct rendering of glyphs in the font. This is particularly useful for rendering text in languages such as Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, where certain glyphs require these tables to be properly displayed.


## **Compatibility Notice**

Starting from this version 23.4.0, we will only support .Net Standard 2.0 and later versions. This change allows us to provide better compatibility with a wider range of platforms.
