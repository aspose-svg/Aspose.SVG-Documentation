{{% /alert %}}

## **Major Features**

As per the regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honored to announce the October release of Aspose.SVG for .NET:

* We have added a new "Image Vectorization" feature that allows to vectorize raster images such as PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, ICO into an SVG document. Under vectorization we mean the process of reducing bitmaps to geometric shapes made up from path elements and stored as SVG.

* Added support for processing JPEG / Exif orientation and rotation properties.

* Fixed the issue with rendering text elements where CSS white-space style is set to 'pre'.
